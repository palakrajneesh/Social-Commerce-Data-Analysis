Project Title: Social Commerce User Behavior Analysis

Goal: To understand what drives sales on a social marketplace. Key Findings:

The "App Effect": Users who have the mobile app are 216% more active buyers than those who only use the website.

Top Markets: The highest sales volumes come from France, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

Social Influence: There is a low correlation between the number of followers and actual products sold, suggesting that "fame" doesn't always equal "sales" on this platform.

Tech Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Google Colab.
